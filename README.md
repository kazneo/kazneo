# 👋 Hi, I’m Kazuki

I’m a **Data & AI Innovator** passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge **machine learning, analytics, and real-world impact**.  
I thrive at the intersection of **data science, software engineering, and business strategy**, turning ideas into scalable solutions.  

My projects span **AI-driven analytics**, **automation pipelines**, and **emerging tech research** like **quantum machine learning**.


## 🧠 What I Love Working On
- 🧩 **Machine Learning & AI Systems** — building predictive, adaptive, and scalable models  
- ⚙️ **Data Engineering & Automation** — transforming raw data into decision-ready insights  
- 🔬 **Emerging Technologies** — exploring quantum algorithms and intelligent automation
<!--
- 💡 **Full-Stack & Cloud Development** — MERN stack, Python, AWS, APIs, microservices  
-->


## 🚀 Selected Projects
### [Luma](https://github.com/The-Luma)
**RAG | Document Understanding | Semantic Search**

A RAG-based web application powered by the ChatGPT 4.0 model, designed to extract, classify, and summarize unstructured text data at scale. Built to provide non-technical users with accessible insights through automated processing, semantic retrieval, and intuitive visualization.
**Highlights:**
- Developed an end-to-end RAG pipeline combining retrieval, transformer-based embeddings, and GPT-4.0 generation
- Implemented semantic search for context-aware document retrieval
- Built an interactive Streamlit web dashboard enabling real-time insights, summaries, and user-driven analysis
- Added role-based access control (RBAC) supporting multiple users with read-only, read/write, and admin permissions
- Designed an admin workflow allowing document-space owners to add or remove users, manage roles, and control access to specific namespaces/collections

**Tech Stack:** `Svelt` · `Rust` · `Pinecone DB` · `GPT-4 API` · `PostgreSQL` · `Docker` 

### Intelligent Automation Insight (Johnson & Johnson Collaboration)
Developed a proof-of-concept ML system to detect similarities between projects, enabling teams to share resources efficiently rather than duplicating effort. 
Helping improve resource allocation across projects, delivering approximately $4.6K savings per project.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` · `SQL` · `Hugging Face`
