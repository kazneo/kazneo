# 👋 Hi, I’m Kazuki

I’m a data and AI engineer focused on turning complex information into clear, actionable insights.
My work sits where machine learning, scalable systems, and product strategy meet, helping teams move from raw data to real impact.
I build intelligent systems, automate workflows, and explore emerging technologies that improve how people interact with information.


## 🧠 What I Love Working On
- 🧩 **Machine Learning & AI Systems** — retrieval systems, predictive models, and applied ML
- ⚙️ **Data Engineering & Automation** — pipelines that make data accessible, reliable, and useful
- 🔬 **Emerging Technologies** — quantum ML, intelligent automation, and next-wave computing

<!--
- 💡 **Full-Stack & Cloud Development** — MERN stack, Python, AWS, APIs, microservices  
-->


## 🚀 Selected Projects
### [Luma](https://github.com/The-Luma)
**RAG | Document Understanding | Semantic Search**

Built a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) platform combining powerd with OpenAI's GPT-4 model, along with a Rust backend and Svelte frentend UI. 
Designed for teams who need fast, context-rich insights from unstructured data.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented an end-to-end RAG pipeline with embeddings, contextual retrieval, and GPT-4 generation
- Built an interactive Svelte UI for real-time exploration, summarization, and analysis
- Added role-based access control and user management features
- Developed backend logic in Rust and integrated Pinecone, PostgreSQL, and containerized deployment

**Tech Stack:** `Svelt` · `Rust` · `Pinecone DB` · `GPT-4 API` · `PostgreSQL` · `Docker` · `Docker` · `Jenkins` · `DigitalOcan (Cloud)` 


### Intelligent Automation Insight (Johnson & Johnson Collaboration)
Designed an ML-driven similarity system to identify reuse opportunities across projects, improving resource allocation and reducing duplicate effort. Delivered measurable cost savings and supported strategic planning.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` · `SQL` · `Hugging Face`
